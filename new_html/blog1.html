                    For Beginners:<br>
                    Start with basic Front End languages : HTML , CSS for making static web pages.<br>
HTML : https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp<br>
CSS : https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp<br>
Once Basic Front End is done one can start with BackEnd. There are various backend languages (Node.js, Python, PHP etc). I would personally suggest going with PHP initially since it is very similar to C/C++ and one will get to know what backend actually means. For database MySQL along with PHP will be best. And if someone is using nodejs go for MongoDB. Once someone knows any backend language moving on to another platform is pretty simple.<br>
PHP : https://www.w3schools.com/php/<br>
http://php.net/manual/en/index.php<br>
NODE.js :https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/<br>
For Those who already have some basic idea of above :<br>
Start with BOOTSTRAP / MATERIALIZE CSS which are basically libraries of CSS already written aFond directly available to use. One doesn’t need to remember all the classes(of HTML elements) name of these libraries, just start using them and you will remember the basic and most frequently used classes automatically.<br>
BOOTSTRAP:http://getbootstrap.com/<br>
MATERIALIZE CSS :http://materializecss.com/<br>
JAVASCRIPT and JQUERY : It is used to program the behavior of web pages and make your pages more responsive based on various ‘Events’. There is hardly any website today that doesn’t used these language.<br>
JAVASCRIPT :https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp<br>
JQUERY :http://api.jquery.com/<br>
https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/<br>
BACKEND : Once basic structure is known we can move on to using FRAMEWORKS.Web frameworks automate the overhead associated with common activities performed (since there is no need to perform a task again and again ) thus reducing our task a lot .<br>
